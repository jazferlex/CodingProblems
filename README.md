# Coding Challenge

## Overview

This Coding Challenge took me a day to finish. I used Python first because it's the language I speak most of the time. I added additional code written in Golang for additional points so I had to learn Golang syntax.

I really enjoyed this challenge.

## Instructions to Run the Code

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jazferlex/CodingProblems.git

Navigate to the problem set directory:

```bash
cd CodingProblems/problem_set_(number)
```

*Replace `(number)` with the number of the problem set you want to run.*

To run the code, use the following command in the terminal:

**Python:**

```bash
python filename.py
```

*Replace `filename.py` with the name of the Python file you want to run.*
